# Connect 4 Python version
A basic python version of connect 4

This is a basic recreation of the popular connect-4 game. Upon beginning the game, the game asks the first player to choose the column they would like to place their piece. Then the next player is asked and the process repeats until the game is won by the traditional rules or if there are no more moves to be made.

Currently if the input is no input (enter pressed immediately) then the game must be restarted. This will be fixed soon.
